### Bio

**Aleksei Fedoroff**, born in August 1984 in Minsk, Republic of Belarus, is an artist and curator.

Initiating his involvement in art and exhibition activities at a young age, Fedoroff transitioned from figurative art, which showcased nontrivial image plasticity and refined work with colours, resulting in images of the highest emotional concentration and profoundness. He then explored performance, installation, radical conceptual art, and eventually ventured into contemporary art, developing novel strategies for form and representation.

Fedoroff rejects confinement within specific genres, opting to create an original model of methodological and technical instruments for each new project. These models amalgamate elements from various visual practices, spanning from oil on canvas to digital art, effectively expressing the conceptual components that play a crucial role in the artist's works.

His artworks are found in private collections across Belarus, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, Spain, Sweden, France, Austria, the UAE, and more. Fedoroff has lived and worked in Minsk, Petersburg, London, and Vilnius.
